<hr />
<p>I was born and raised in the Philippines.
  I am a professional freelancer specializing in Social Media Marketing and management, <br>SEO, Web Designing, Photo and Video Editing, and Graphics Designs.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always make sure to give my best in everything I do. <br>Being the independent person I am, I strive to get what I want and need and always go the extra mile to reach my goal. <br>When everyone was watching Netflix, I was reading books.</p>

<p>I find trust, Integrity, perseverance, and professionalism to be the most valuable qualities when it comes to success.</p>
<p>Fueled by my passion for technology, problem-solving, and photography, I am here to share stories, Photos, Videos, and experiences that intend to inspire people.
  I dedicate my free time researching, learning new tools, and developing skills that I can use for my freelancing career because my goal is to be the best at what I do.</p>
